        <strong>Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?</strong>
        <p>When we have IO on event loop's 4th queue and we want to run function before close event is called we can use setImmediate.
            If event loop's queues are empty then setTimeout and setImmediate will called in order of event loop.
        </p>

        <strong>Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?</strong>
        <p>Difference is nextTick's function will be called immediately after finishing current function regardless of event loops queue because it has more priority.
            setImmediate will be called on 5th queue of event loop so it has less priority.
